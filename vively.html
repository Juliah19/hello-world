        <h3> What the project is. </h3>
        <p> 
<p>Vively is an application for the Apple Watch that gives the user insight to their stress and sedentary habits. Through extensive user testing and research, I designed and prototyped this application in the hopes that it can nudge people towards living a healthier day.
Vively was my BFA senior thesis. I presented the concept along with a vision demo and prototype at the Redline Art Gallery in Denver, CO.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
How can behavioral design be used to facilitate mindfulness of stress and sedentary time?
</p>
      <h2>Research</h2>
<p>I began this project by exploring the problem of chronic stress and the effects of long term sedentary time. Research shows that living with chronic stress and a seminary lifestyle is detrimental to our health. While the obvious solution to offset sedentary time is to hit the gym or go for a hike over the weekend. However it’s not that simple as the damage from prolonged periods of sitting has already been done. Our modern lifestyle and the technology that makes our lives easier is the cause of of these problems, but could it be a possible solution as well? 
 </p>

 <h3>Talking to People</h3>

<p>I originally settled on attempting to solve this problem by talking with uses. I asked users what they were concerned with regarding stress and we brainstormed different areas regarding health and happiness, particularly at workplace since that is where the majority of their day is spent. Topics that emerged were ergonomics, stress from deadlines, employer incentives, limited food options, water intake, using standing desks, using the Pomodoro technique to help with focus, etc. We also talked about what ways could be used to motivate users to make healthier decisions. Users agreed that positive reinforcement, gamification, and having small achievable goals would be key. I began by narrowing down the problem space to two basic components: stress and sedentary time. </p>

<h3>Formative Survey</h3>
<p>Next, I conducted a formative survey in which I asked users how much stress they experience on a daily basis. 42% of people said they experience stress half of the day or more on a daily basis. 67% self reported that they sit for long periods of time during the day. I also asked if they currently use any health or fitness related apps and found that 48% have at least once. 14% said they use one on a daily basis. The main reasons people used these types of applications were to track their personal goals such as getting in enough steps for the day or to track their eating habits. 
</p>

 <h3>Behavior Design and Nudge Theory</h3>
   
<p> 
  I looked extensively at behavioral design because of its potential to create behavior change in the end user. Behavioral design is the study of social and cognitive psychology, learning how people think and the processes behind decision making, and applying that to create the best user experience. The belief underlying behavioral design is that people don’t act as rational decision makers. Within behavioral design is the concept of “nudging”. According to behavior design expert, Sille Krukow, “Nudging is an attempt to influence people’s choices and behavior in a predictable way without limiting their options or significantly changing their incentives”.    I wanted to take the concept of nudging and use it for my problem.  As a result of studying nudging through professors, attending a workshop with behavior design experts, I learned enough to map out my goal to make a successful behavior design campaign for the purposes of solving a problem people face everyday. 
</p>

<h3>Competitive Space</h3>
<p>
I researched other applications that attempt to solve similar problems. There are multiple applications that focus on different aspects of wellness such as stress and breath tracking.  I found that often what was lacking in these applications was the ability to alert the user of undesired behavior immediatly rather than having them recall those actions at a later time. Trying to encourage positive behavior is most effective if reminders can at the time the decision is made. 
 </p>

<h2>OPPORTUNITY</h2>

<p>Based on my research with users and current technology, I decided the solution would be a mobile application with an accompanying app for the Apple Watch.  The app will monitor the users heart rate, movement, and breathing and use this information to determine their level of stress and how long they’ve been sitting and suggest appropriate actions to the user to curb their behavior for the better. The application for the Apple Watch will consist of immediate feedback information and timely persuasive messages, while the mobile application will offer additional functionality, including historial data, goals, and settings.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p> The goals for this application are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1) Raise awareness of the users typical stress and sedentary patterns </li>
  <li>2) Reduce the level of stress through mindful awareness </li>
  <li>3) Reduce sedentary behavior by nudging users to move more throughout the day </li>
</ul>  
<p>In order persuade users to change their behavior, the solution will need three things - a method to passively monitor human activity, a method to provide feedback about behavior and technology that suggests a behavior at the most opportune moment. </p>

    <h2>Moving into the Design Phase </h2>
<h3>Early Ideas + Wireframes</h3>
    <p>
I kept in mind how users could use the app and what level of engagement would be required. I learned from behavioral design, that users are more likely to stick with their target behavior when focus is only on one or two elements at a time. I designed a way for users to see their current physical and emotional states and a way to easily tell what their objectives are. What I came up with was a visualization using a series of rings. The two main components  of the app is the Calm gauge, and the Movement gauge. 
<img src="vively/vivelywireframe.png"> 
With each of these, the goal is to fill the daily goal ring everyday.  When the user is in a calmed state or not sitting down, the timer counts down and every time it's reached, the respective daily goal counter is credited. The default settings for the Movement Gauge is to stand for at least 5 minutes out of 10 different hours of the day. For the Stress Gauge it’s to remain in a calmed state for at least 20 minutes out of 10 different hours. And if you’ve been sitting or in a stressed state for almost an hour, the application will notify the user.

<h3>Rapid prototyping and testing</h3>
<p>With my initial designs, I created a simple low fidelity prototype using Marvel. I showed the prototype for the mobile application to users to get their impressions and reveal pain points in usability testing. For the watch component, I was not able to use the prototype on an actual watch, so I instead conducted moderated usability testing on a desktop screen.

Feedback I received was mostly positive, however there were a few consistent pain points across testers. 

</p>
<ul>
<li> There was confusion between the daily goal ring and the current goal timer</li>
<li> Users were unsure what actions to take from reporting. </li>
<li> When asked, what their current state was according to the app, users were unsure or answered incorrectly</li>
</ul>

<p>
The iteration process revealed that the main component of the stress and movement gauge was a little confusing to users. I simplified the original design down to be more understandable by clarifying difference between the daily goal ring and the current goal timer. Now there is only one goal ring and the timer was converted to a rounded fill-up meter. The use of iconography also clarified the current status of the user. The new interface is easier to read and more understandable at a glance. </p>

<h2>Presenation</h2>
 <h3> Branding</h3>
 <p>I created a word map associating everything that represented the application’s culture, feeling, and narrative. I studied naming strategies for mobile apps that resonate with users. What I came up with was Vively. It conveys energy, focus, and positivity. I sketched and iterated several logo ideas before deciding on the final choice.
 </p>

<h3>Prototype and Video Demo</h3>
<p>Finally, I refined the click-through prototype using the information  gathered from testing with users. 
Along with the hi-fidelity prototype, I also created a video demonstrating the application to showcase in a gallery setting.
